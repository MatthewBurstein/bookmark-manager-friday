# Bookmark Manager

The website will have the following **specification**:

* Show a list of links
* Add new links
* Delete links
* Update links
* Tag links into categories
* Filter links by tag

> A specification is a list of **requirements**.

We'll be using a BDD cycle (i.e. **outside-in testing**: Capybara first).

To guide us, create some User Stories and sketch a high-level domain model.

first user story:
```
As a user,
So I can see my bookmarked pages,
I would like see a list of links.
```

second user story:
```
As a user,
So that I can personalise my Bookmark manager,
I'd like to add links to it.
```

To get started
```
clone https://github.com/tamasmagyarhunor88/bookmark_manager_monday.git
bundle install
rake setup
```
